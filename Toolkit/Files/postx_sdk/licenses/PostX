BY CLICKING ON THE "I ACCEPT" BUTTON OR INSTALLING OR USING THE SOFTWARE, LICENSEE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT LICENSEE HAS READ THIS AGREEMENT AND AGREES TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, CLICK ON THE "I DO NOT AGREE" BUTTON BELOW, DO NOT INSTALL OR USE THE SOFTWARE AND RETURN THE SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION TO THE DISTRIBUTOR FROM WHOM YOU PURCHASED THE SOFTWARE FOR A REFUND OF THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU FOR THE SOFTWARE.

IN THE EVENT THAT LICENSEE AND POSTX CORPORATION HAVE EACH SIGNED A WRITTEN AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCTS (OTHER THAN A "CLICK- THROUGH" AGREEMENT), THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SUCH EXECUTED AGREEMENT SHALL EXCLUSIVELY GOVERN LICENSEE'S PURCHASE AND USE OF THE PRODUCTS AND THE FOLLOWING AGREEMENT SHALL BE NULL AND VOID AND OF NO FORCE OR EFFECT.

ASSENT: By clicking on the "I Accept" button, Licensee agrees (i) that this Agreement is a legally binding and valid contract, (ii) to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and (iii) to take all necessary steps to ensure that the terms and conditions of this Agreement are not violated by any person or entity under Licensee's control or in Licensee's service.

GRANT OF LICENSE: During the term of this Agreement, Licensor grants to Licensee a limited, personal, fee-bearing, non-exclusive, non- sublicensable, non-transferable, non-assignable license solely to install, execute, operate and use internally the single object code format copy of the PostX software that this Agreement accompanies (the "Software") on a single computer, provided that Licensee complies with all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement (the "License").  Licensee may not use the Software on more than one (1) computer simultaneously.  Licensee may only use the Software for the purposes of encrypting human-initiated email.  The use of the Software for the purposes of encrypting automatically or programmatically generated electronic statements, bills, marketing messages or CRM responses is expressly prohibited.  Licensee may make one copy of the Software and Documentation for backup and archival purposes only, provided that Licensee reproduces the copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights notices appearing in the Software and/or Documentation, as applicable.  The foregoing is an express limited-use license and not an assignment, sale or other transfer of the Software, the Documentation or any Intellectual Property Rights (as defined below) of Licensor.  All rights not specifically granted to Licensee under this Agreement are reserved by Licensor.

SPECIFIC RESTRICTIONS: Licensee will not, except as expressly permitted under this Agreement, (i) use, reproduce, distribute or otherwise transfer the Software or Documentation; (ii) reverse engineer (except to the extent that applicable law prohibits restrictions thereon), disassemble, or decompile the Software in whole or in part, or otherwise attempt to reconstruct or discover any source code or algorithms embodied by the Software by any means whatsoever; (iii) alter or modify the Software or Documentation; (iv) distribute, sell, sublicense, lend, rent, lease, delegate, assign or otherwise transfer Licensee's rights in the License granted under this Agreement or otherwise allow others to use the Software or Documentation; (v) merge or embed the Software into any other computer program; (vi) create derivative works of the Software or Documentation; (vii) remove, alter or obscure the copyright, trademark or other intellectual property rights notices included in the Software or Documentation; or (viii) use the Software for a service bureau or on a time sharing basis.

In the event of termination, Licensee must cease using, and return to Distributor, the Software and Documentation.

Licensee agrees not to modify or disable metering tool.

SUPPORT: Subject to Licensee's payment of the applicable upgrade, support and maintenance fees, and the terms and conditions applicable to such upgrades, support and maintenance, Licensee may contact the Distributor for support with respect to the Software.  Licensor shall not be obligated to provide any support, maintenance or updates for the Software to Licensee directly.

EXPORT RESTRICTIONS: The Software (including but not limited to technology embodied thereby) (i) is subject to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and other U.S. law, and (ii) may not be exported or re-exported to certain countries (currently Cuba, North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria or Sudan) or to persons or entities prohibited from receiving U.S. exports (including Denied Parties, entities on the Bureau of Export Administration Entity List, and Specially Designated Nationals).

Licensee shall comply in all respects with all laws, regulations, rules, orders and treaties applicable to the Software and Documentation and/or the use thereof, including but not limited to, laws, regulations, rules, orders and treaties with respect to export.  By accepting this Agreement, Licensee warrants that it is not located in, under the control of or a national or resident of, any country subject to export restrictions that prohibit the license of the Software or Documentation to Licensee.

LIMITATION OF WARRANTY: Licensee assumes responsibility for the selection of the Software to achieve Licensee's intended results and for the installation and use of, and the results obtained from, the Software.  Licensor does not warrant that the functions or features contained in Software will meet Licensee's requirements or that the operation of the Software will be uninterrupted or error free.  

EXCEPT AS PROVIDED HEREIN, THE SOFTWARE, THE DOCUMENTATION AND ANY SERVICES RELATED TO THE SOFTWARE ARE BEING PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND LICENSOR HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED IN RESPECT OF THE SOFTWARE, THE DOCUMENTATION AND THE RELATED SERVICES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTIES AS TO NON-INFRINGEMENT.  LICENSOR MAY BE ENTITLED TO STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE LAW, HOWEVER, TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER SUCH LAW, THE DURATION OF ANY SUCH WARRANTIES SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE PERIOD COMMENCING ON THE EFFECTIVE DATE AND ENDING NINETY (90) DAYS THEREAFTER.

LIMITATION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES: The remedies provided in this Agreement are the sole and exclusive remedies available to Licensee for any breach to which such remedy pertains.  The aggregate liability of Licensor to Licensee for any and all damages, liabilities, losses, costs and expenses including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees (collectively, "Losses") arising out of or related to this Agreement, the Software, the Documentation or the related services, whether in contract, indemnity, equity, negligence, intended conduct, tort or otherwise, will be limited to and will not exceed, in the aggregate, the amount actually paid by Licensee for the License to the Software.  In any event Licensor shall have no liability for any Losses arising after the earlier of (i) the expiration of twelve (12) months from the date of Licensee's purchase order for the License of the Software or (ii) the termination of this Agreement.  IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, PROSPECTIVE PROFITS, ANTICIPATED SALES OR GOOD WILL, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF CONFIDENTIAL OR OTHER INFORMATION OR REPROCUREMENT COSTS) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE OR THE DOCUMENTATION, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  LICENSOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY DELAY IN DELIVERY OF THE SOFTWARE.  THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY AND ARE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS AGREEMENT.

INDEMNIFICATION: Licensor will defend Licensee against all third party claims, actions and demands (collectively "Claims") brought against Licensee and will pay any judgments, settlements and reasonable costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees, incurred by Licensee as a result thereof, to the extent such Claim is based on the infringement by the Software of any patent, copyright or other intellectual property right of a third party.  In the event that the Software in the opinion of Licensor is likely to, or does become the subject of a Claim, Licensor may, at its sole option and expense, either (i) procure for Licensee the right to continue using the Software, (ii) modify the Software to make it non-infringing, (iii) substitute software of similar capability, or (iv) terminate this Agreement and refund a pro-rata portion of the amount paid for the License to the Software depreciated on a straight line basis over three years starting on the date Distributor received the applicable purchase order.  The obligations of Licensor under this Section are conditioned on Licensee giving Licensor (a) prompt written notice of any Claim for which indemnification is sought; (b) complete control of the defense and settlement of such Claim if requested by Licensor; and (c) assistance and cooperation in such defense as Licensor may reasonably request provided that reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred by Licensee shall be reimbursed promptly by Licensor.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensor assumes no liability for and will have no indemnity obligation as to (1) infringement resulting from the use, operation or combination of the Software or Documentation with any product, service or other material not provided by Licensor, if such infringement would not have occurred based solely on the Software or Documentation; (2) infringement relating to the modification or servicing of the Software or Documentation, or any part thereof, by anyone other than Licensor or its authorized agent; (3) failure of Licensee to implement any updates to the Software or Documentation, if the infringement would have been avoided by the use of the update; and (4) infringement arising from uses of the Software or Documentation other than in strict compliance with the License (collectively, the "Exclusions").  Licensee shall indemnify and defend Licensor and hold it harmless against any Claims asserted by third parties that arise out of or are related to the Exclusions or Licensee's use of the Software other than in strict compliance with the law and the License.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement, the foregoing states Licensor's entire liability and obligation, and Licensee's sole remedy with respect to infringement or claims of infringement of any intellectual property rights arising under or related to the Software or Documentation.  

CONFIDENTAL INFORMATION: Licensee acknowledges that (i) the Software and Documentation, (ii) the license and support services pricing, and (ii) the limitation of liability, indemnification and warranty terms herein are confidential and/or proprietary to Licensor.  Licensee shall not disclose such information to any third party and agrees to take all reasonably necessary action to protect such information, including appropriate instructions and agreements with employees and agents of Licensee. 

NOTICES AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION: Any notices to be given under this Agreement shall be (i) sent to the Licensor's address (available at www.postx.com) to the attention of the CEO and copied to its Legal Department, or to Licensee's last address known to Licensor, as applicable; (ii) delivered by hand, via US Mail (postage prepaid, certified or registered), or via a recognized courier service; and (iii) deemed given upon receipt.  All disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be resolved by binding arbitration conducted in San Francisco, California, United States of America under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.  The parties shall bear equally the cost of the arbitration (exclusive of legal fees and expenses of the parties, all of which each party shall bear separately).  All decisions of the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding on both parties and enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of breach by Licensee of its obligations hereunder, the Licensor may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction.  

PUBLICITY:  Licensee agrees that during the term of this Agreement Licensor may publicly refer to Licensee, orally and in writing, as a customer of Licensor.  Any other written reference to Licensee by Licensor requires the prior approval of Licensee. 

FEDERAL PROCUREMENTS:  This section applies to all acquisitions of the Software by or for the Federal Government or by any prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier) under any contract, grant, cooperative agreement or other transaction with the Federal Government which calls for delivery or use of the Software or Documentation by the Government.  By accepting delivery of the Software, the Government agrees that the Software qualifies as commercial computer software and that the associated documentation qualifies as commercial computer software documentation within the meaning of the acquisition regulations and contract clauses applicable to this procurement.  The terms and conditions of this Agreement are fully applicable to the Government's use and disclosure of the Software and Documentation, and shall supersede any conflicting terms or conditions.  If this Agreement fails to meet the Government's stated needs or is inconsistent in any respect with Federal law, the Government agrees to return the Software and Documentation, unused, to the Distributor.

No license of any kind is granted in the case of acquisitions which contain or are subject to the clauses FAR 52-227.19 COMMERCIAL COMPUTER SOFTWARE-RESTRICTED RIGHTS (JUNE 1987) or any other clause which purports to grant to the Government rights greater than, or additional to those, set forth in this Agreement, or which purports to impose additional requirements upon the Licensor to make the Agreement effective, unless the Licensor specifically so consents by separate written agreement.  Failing such agreement, the Government agrees to return the Software and Documentation unused to the Distributor.  
GENERAL: This Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between Licensee and Licensor, and this Agreement supersedes any prior or contemporaneous proposal, agreement, or communication, whether oral or written, pertaining to the subject matter of this Agreement and there are no inducements to enter into this Agreement which are not set forth herein.  The Software and Documentation provided hereunder are provided subject to the terms and conditions stated in this Agreement, which supercede any additional or different terms and conditions contained in Licensee's purchase order(s) or any other Licensee document; Licensor hereby objects to the terms and conditions of such Licensee documents to the extent they conflict herewith.  This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California and of the United States of America, excluding (i) their respective conflicts of law principles and (ii) the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.  This Agreement may not be assigned, in whole or in part, by Licensee, absent Licensor's prior written consent.  Licensor may freely assign this Agreement.  Subject to the foregoing restriction on assignment, this Agreement shall apply to and bind the permitted successors and assigns of the parties.  No modification or waiver of this Agreement, or any portion hereof, shall be binding unless executed in writing by the party to be bound thereby.  If any provision of this Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, invalid or illegal, such provision shall be interpreted to have the broadest application as shall be enforceable, valid and legal, but if such provision cannot be interpreted to be enforceable, valid and legal, then such provision shall be severed and be of no effect.  The invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any particular provision of this Agreement shall not affect the other provisions hereof, which shall continue in full force and effect.  To accept this Agreement and continue installation of the Software, click "I Agree".  To decline, click "I Do Not Agree" and return the Software and Documentation to the Distributor.
